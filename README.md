## What is Mesh?

Mesh is a general-purpose programming language designed to make concurrent software scalable, fault-tolerant, and maintainable. It combines the **expressive syntax of Ruby/Elixir** and the **fault-tolerant actor model of Erlang/BEAM** with **static Hindley-Milner type inference** and **native performance via LLVM**.

Mesh compiles directly to a standalone native binary—no virtual machine to install, no heavy runtime to manage.

## Key Features

### Safety Without Verbosity
- **Static Type System:** Full compile-time type checking with Hindley-Milner inference. You rarely need to write type annotations.
- **Null Safety:** No nulls. Use `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` with pattern matching.
- **Pattern Matching:** Exhaustive pattern matching on all types, ensuring you handle every case.

### Concurrency & Reliability
- **Actor Model:** Lightweight processes (green threads) isolated by default. Spawn 100k+ actors in seconds.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Supervision trees and "let it crash" philosophy. If an actor crashes, its supervisor restarts it—the rest of your app stays up.
- **Message Passing:** Actors communicate exclusively via immutable messages. No shared memory, no data races.
- **Distributed Mesh:** Seamlessly cluster nodes. Send messages to remote actors as easily as local ones using location-transparent PIDs.

### Production Ready
- **Native Binaries:** Compiles to a single, self-contained executable. Easy to deploy (copy-paste).
- **Batteries Included:**
  - Built-in **PostgreSQL** & **SQLite** drivers with connection pooling.
  - **WebSocket** server support (actor-per-connection).
  - **JSON** serialization/deserialization.
  - **HTTP** server with routing and middleware.
- **Modern Tooling:** Built-in package manager, formatter (`mesh fmt`), and Language Server Protocol (LSP) support for your editor.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

**From Source (Rust required):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mesh-lang/mesh.git
cd mesh
cargo install --path crates/meshc
```

### 2. Hello World

Create a file named `hello.mesh`:

```elixir
module Main

pub fn main() do
  IO.println("Hello, Mesh world!")
  
  # Spawn an actor
  let pid = spawn(fn -> 
    receive
      {sender, name} -> send(sender, "Nice to meet you, " + name)
    end
  end)

  # Send a message and wait for reply
  send(pid, {self(), "Developer"})
  
  receive
    msg -> IO.println("Received: " + msg)
  after 1000 ->
    IO.println("Timeout!")
  end
end
```

Run it:

```bash
meshc run hello.mesh
```

### 3. A Web Server Example

```elixir
module Server

import Http
import Json

struct User do
  id: Int
  name: String
  email: String
end

pub fn main() do
  let router = Http.router()
    |> Http.get("/", fn(req) -> 
        Http.text(200, "Welcome to Mesh!") 
       end)
    |> Http.post("/users", fn(req) ->
        case req.json() do
          Ok(user :: User) -> Http.json(201, user)
          Err(_) -> Http.text(400, "Invalid JSON")
        end
       end)

  IO.println("Listening on port 8080...")
  Http.serve(router, 8080)
end
```
