//! Test runtime support functions for the Mesh testing framework (Phase 138).
//!
//! Provides `extern "C"` functions called by compiled `*.test.mpl` programs.
//! The test harness (lowered by Plan 03) calls these functions to:
//!   - Begin each test (`mesh_test_begin`)
//!   - Record pass/fail outcomes (`mesh_test_pass`, `mesh_test_fail_msg`)
//!   - Assert conditions (`mesh_test_assert`, `mesh_test_assert_eq`,
//!     `mesh_test_assert_ne`, `mesh_test_assert_raises`)
//!   - Print summary at the end of the run (`mesh_test_summary`)
//!   - Clean up mock actors (`mesh_test_cleanup_actors`)
//!
//! ## State model
//!
//! All state is kept in `thread_local!` statics. Tests run single-threaded
//! from the generated `main`, so no locking is required.
//!
//! ## Failure output
//!
//! Failures print inline as each test fails, and are also accumulated in
//! `FAIL_MESSAGES`. `mesh_test_summary` reprints all failures in a
//! `Failures:` section before the final count line.
//!
//! ## assert_raises mechanism
//!
//! `mesh_test_assert_raises` uses a flag-based mechanism to detect whether
//! a closure "raised" (i.e., triggered a failing assertion). This avoids
//! panicking through `extern "C"` closures, which aborts in Rust 1.73+.
//! See the `IN_ASSERT_RAISES` / `ASSERT_RAISES_TRIGGERED` thread-locals.
