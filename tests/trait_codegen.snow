-- Smoke test for trait method codegen pipeline (Phase 19).
--
-- STATUS: MIR lowering works correctly (108 tests pass).
-- Full compilation blocked by typeck type identity issue:
--   "expected Point, found Point" -- self parameter type in impl method
--   is considered a different Point than the struct literal's Point.
-- This is a typeck gap (not codegen) to resolve in gap closure.
--
-- When this compiles and runs, it should print: a point

struct Point do
  x :: Int
  y :: Int
end

interface Describable do
  fn describe(self) -> String
end

impl Describable for Point do
  fn describe(self) -> String do
    "a point"
  end
end

fn main() do
  let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 }
  println(describe(p))
end
