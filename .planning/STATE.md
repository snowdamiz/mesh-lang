# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-05)

**Core value:** Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural as sequential code, with supervision and fault tolerance built in.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 in progress. Parser crate scaffolded; next up is Pratt expression parsing.

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Parser & AST)
Plan: 1 of 5 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-06 -- Completed 02-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 10% (4 plans of ~41 estimated total)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 5min
- Total execution time: 19min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-project-foundation-lexer | 3/3 | 12min | 4min |
| 02-parser-ast | 1/5 | 7min | 7min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3min), 01-02 (5min), 01-03 (4min), 02-01 (7min)
- Trend: slight increase (parser more complex than lexer scaffolding)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Compiler pipeline phases (1-5) must complete before actor runtime (Phase 6) -- sequential code first, actors later
- [Roadmap]: Actor runtime (libsnowrt) developed as standalone Rust library tested independently before compiler integration
- [Roadmap]: Type system and pattern matching are separate phases due to individual complexity and risk
- [01-01]: 39 keywords (not 37 as plan header stated) -- when, where, with bring the actual count to 39
- [01-01]: SelfKw variant for self keyword (Rust keyword conflict avoidance)
- [01-01]: Match-based keyword dispatch over HashMap (compiler optimizes string matching)
- [01-02]: StringMode enum state machine (None/Single/Triple) with pending_token queue for string tokenization
- [01-02]: Comments skip optional leading space after delimiter for cleaner content spans
- [01-03]: State stack (Vec<LexerState>) replaces StringMode for nested interpolation contexts
- [01-03]: InString stays on stack when InInterpolation pushed; pop returns to string scanning
- [01-03]: Pending token queue (Vec<Token>) for multi-token emissions
- [01-03]: All newlines emit as Newline tokens; parser decides significance
- [01-03]: Bare pipe | produces Error token; struct update syntax needs parser-level handling
- [02-01]: SyntaxKind uses SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE with #[allow(non_camel_case_types)] (rowan convention)
- [02-01]: Comments always trivia in parser (skipped by lookahead, preserved in CST)
- [02-01]: Forward parent technique for open_before() wrapping (matklad pattern)
- [02-01]: Parser internals pub(crate); public API deferred to 02-05
- [02-01]: Lexer does not emit whitespace tokens; WHITESPACE SyntaxKind exists for future use

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Type System) is highest intellectual risk -- HM inference has subtle implementation pitfalls
- Phase 6 (Actor Runtime) is highest engineering risk -- preemptive scheduling, per-actor GC, work-stealing
- Typed actor messaging (TYPE-07) is a research-level problem -- design on paper during early phases
