# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural as sequential code, with supervision and fault tolerance built in.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

(See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full log)

- Quick-1: File extension .mpl chosen for Mesh source files (not .mesh to avoid .mesh/ directory confusion)
- Quick-1: Delete and regenerate snapshots rather than manual edit (simpler, guarantees correctness)
