# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-05)

**Core value:** Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural as sequential code, with supervision and fault tolerance built in.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Project Foundation & Lexer

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Project Foundation & Lexer)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-06 -- Completed 01-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] ~3% (1 plan of ~30 estimated total)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3min
- Total execution time: 3min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-project-foundation-lexer | 1/3 | 3min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3min)
- Trend: baseline established

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Compiler pipeline phases (1-5) must complete before actor runtime (Phase 6) -- sequential code first, actors later
- [Roadmap]: Actor runtime (libsnowrt) developed as standalone Rust library tested independently before compiler integration
- [Roadmap]: Type system and pattern matching are separate phases due to individual complexity and risk
- [01-01]: 39 keywords (not 37 as plan header stated) -- when, where, with bring the actual count to 39
- [01-01]: SelfKw variant for self keyword (Rust keyword conflict avoidance)
- [01-01]: Match-based keyword dispatch over HashMap (compiler optimizes string matching)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Type System) is highest intellectual risk -- HM inference has subtle implementation pitfalls
- Phase 6 (Actor Runtime) is highest engineering risk -- preemptive scheduling, per-actor GC, work-stealing
- Typed actor messaging (TYPE-07) is a research-level problem -- design on paper during early phases
