<objective>
Write Distributed Actors and Tooling documentation pages for Mesh.

Purpose: Fulfills DOCS-07 (distributed actors) and DOCS-08 (developer tooling), completing the remaining documentation coverage areas.
Output: Two complete markdown doc pages ready for sidebar integration.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write Distributed Actors documentation (DOCS-07)</name>
  <files>website/docs/docs/distributed/index.md</files>
  <action>
Create the distributed actors documentation page at website/docs/docs/distributed/index.md covering:

1. **Overview** - Brief explanation of Mesh's distributed actor model: same actor primitives (spawn, send, receive) work across nodes, with cookie-based authentication for security
2. **Starting a Node** - `Node.start(name, cookie)` with naming convention `"name@host:port"`, explanation that this enables the current process to accept remote connections
3. **Connecting Nodes** - `Node.connect(name)` to establish a connection, `Node.list()` to see connected nodes, `Node.self()` to get current node name
4. **Remote Actors** - Spawning actors that can receive messages from remote nodes, sending to remote PIDs (processes are addressable across nodes once connected)
5. **Global Registry** - `Global.register(name, pid)` to register a process globally, `Global.whereis(name)` to find a process by name, `Global.unregister(name)` to remove registration -- emphasize this works across all connected nodes
6. **Node Monitoring** - `Node.monitor(name)` to receive notifications when a remote node disconnects

All code examples derived from the codegen mapping in `mir/lower.rs` lines 9531-9544 and runtime source in `crates/mesh-rt/src/dist/`. No e2e tests exist for distributed features, so note that examples are derived from the runtime API surface.

Add frontmatter: `title: "Distributed Actors"` and `description: "Node connections, remote actors, and global process registry in Mesh"`.
  </action>
  <verify>
The file exists at website/docs/docs/distributed/index.md, contains mesh code blocks, covers node start/connect, global registry, and monitoring. Verify function names match codegen: Node -> `node_*`, Global -> `global_*`.
  </verify>
  <done>Distributed docs page has 5+ sections covering nodes, connections, remote actors, global registry, and monitoring with accurate Mesh code examples</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write Tooling documentation (DOCS-08)</name>
  <files>website/docs/docs/tooling/index.md</files>
  <action>
Create the tooling documentation page at website/docs/docs/tooling/index.md covering:

1. **Overview** - Mesh ships with a complete developer toolchain built into the `meshc` binary
2. **Formatter** - `meshc fmt [file]` command, mention Wadler-Lindig pretty-printing algorithm, CST-based formatting that preserves comments, format-on-save setup
3. **REPL** - `meshc repl` command, interactive exploration, LLVM JIT compilation for instant feedback, mention it runs the full compiler pipeline
4. **Package Manager** - `meshc new [name]` for project scaffolding, explain manifest and lockfile concepts, dependency resolution
5. **Language Server (LSP)** - `meshc lsp` command, protocol (stdio JSON-RPC), features: diagnostics, hover, go-to-definition. Mention tower-lsp for protocol handling
6. **Editor Support** - VS Code extension in `editors/vscode-mesh/`, TextMate grammar for syntax highlighting, language configuration for bracket matching and auto-indentation, how to install (open the extension folder in VS Code, or reference the .vsix if built)

Use `bash` code fences for CLI commands, `mesh` code fences for Mesh code examples, and `json` code fences for configuration snippets.

Add frontmatter: `title: "Developer Tools"` and `description: "Formatter, REPL, package manager, LSP, and editor support for Mesh"`.
  </action>
  <verify>
The file exists at website/docs/docs/tooling/index.md, covers all 5 tools (formatter, REPL, package manager, LSP, editor support). Verify CLI commands match actual binary: `meshc fmt`, `meshc repl`, `meshc new`, `meshc lsp`.
  </verify>
  <done>Tooling docs page has 5+ sections covering formatter, REPL, package manager, LSP, and editor support with accurate CLI commands</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Both markdown files exist and have appropriate length
2. Distributed docs use `mesh` code fences with Node.*/Global.* API
3. Tooling docs use `bash` code fences for CLI commands and `mesh` for code examples
4. Function names match the codegen mapping and crate CLIs
5. Consistent formatting with existing docs
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- website/docs/docs/distributed/index.md exists with comprehensive node, remote actor, and global registry documentation
- website/docs/docs/tooling/index.md exists with comprehensive formatter, REPL, package manager, LSP, and editor support documentation
- All API names and CLI commands verified against source
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/73-extended-content-polish/73-02-SUMMARY.md`
