### v10.1 Stabilization (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Fix all 47 Mesher compilation errors introduced during the v10.0 ORM integration (phases 96-103), rebuild Mesher successfully, and verify all HTTP/WebSocket endpoints work correctly end-to-end.

- [x] **Phase 104: Fix Mesher Compilation Errors** - Resolve all 47 errors across 6 files to achieve zero-error build
- [ ] **Phase 105: Verify Mesher Runtime** - Confirm Mesher runs, connects to PostgreSQL, and all endpoints work

## Phase Details

### Phase 104: Fix Mesher Compilation Errors
**Goal**: Mesher compiles with zero errors -- all type mismatches, undefined variables, incorrect `?` usage, missing module references, and argument count errors across queries.mpl, org.mpl, project.mpl, user.mpl, team.mpl, and main.mpl are resolved
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v10.1)
**Requirements**: FIX-01, FIX-02, FIX-03, FIX-04, FIX-05, FIX-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `meshc build mesher` completes with zero compilation errors and produces a binary
  2. All Repo/Query calls in queries.mpl use correct return types (Map and Result) with no Ptr-vs-Map or Map-vs-Result mismatches
  3. All service files (org.mpl, project.mpl, user.mpl) reference only variables that are in scope -- no undefined variable errors from ORM migration artifacts
  4. The `?` operator is used only on expressions returning Result or Option types -- no E0037 errors remain
  5. All module imports resolve correctly in team.mpl and main.mpl, and all function calls pass the correct number of arguments
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 104-01-PLAN.md -- Fix Repo typeck signatures and verify zero-error Mesher build

### Phase 105: Verify Mesher Runtime
**Goal**: Mesher runs as a working application -- it starts, connects to PostgreSQL, serves HTTP API requests with correct responses, and accepts WebSocket connections
**Depends on**: Phase 104
**Requirements**: VER-01, VER-02, VER-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Mesher binary starts without runtime crashes and successfully connects to a PostgreSQL database (prints connection confirmation or serves first request)
  2. HTTP GET endpoints (e.g., organization list, project list) return valid JSON responses with correct status codes
  3. HTTP POST endpoints (e.g., create organization, create project) accept JSON payloads and persist data to the database
  4. WebSocket endpoint accepts connections, completes the upgrade handshake, and responds to messages
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 105-01-PLAN.md -- Database setup, migration, and Mesher binary startup verification
- [ ] 105-02-PLAN.md -- HTTP endpoint testing and WebSocket connectivity verification
