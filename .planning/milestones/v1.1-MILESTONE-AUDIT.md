# Milestone Audit: v1.1 Language Polish

**Audited:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** PASSED
**Milestone Goal:** Fix all five documented v1.0 limitations -- multi-clause functions, string pattern matching, pipe operator with closures, actor-per-connection HTTP, and generic map types.

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Status |

| SYN-01 | Multi-clause function definitions | 11 | ✓ Satisfied |
| SYN-02 | Multi-clause exhaustiveness checking | 11 | ✓ Satisfied |
| SYN-03 | Type inference across clauses | 11 | ✓ Satisfied |
| SYN-04 | Pipe into inline closures | 12 | ✓ Satisfied |
| SYN-05 | Nested do/end and fn/end in pipe chains | 12 | ✓ Satisfied |
| PAT-01 | String literal matching with compile-time codegen | 13 | ✓ Satisfied |
| PAT-02 | String patterns in exhaustiveness checking | 13 | ✓ Satisfied |
| MAP-01 | Generic Map<K, V> types | 14 | ✓ Satisfied |
| MAP-02 | Map functions with string keys | 14 | ✓ Satisfied |
| MAP-03 | Map literal syntax with string keys | 14 | ✓ Satisfied |
| HTTP-01 | Actor-per-connection HTTP server | 15 | ✓ Satisfied |
| HTTP-02 | Actor supervision / crash isolation | 15 | ✓ Satisfied |

**Score: 12/12 requirements satisfied (100%)**

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Goal | Verification Status | Score | Date |
|-------|------|---------------------|-------|------|
| 11: Multi-Clause Functions | Pattern-matched function clauses | PASSED | 27/27 must-haves | 2026-02-07 |
| 12: Pipe Operator Closures | Inline closures in pipe chains | PASSED | 3/3 success criteria | 2026-02-07 |
| 13: String Pattern Matching | Compile-time string comparison in case | PASSED | 5/5 must-haves | 2026-02-07 |
| 14: Generic Map Types | Map<K, V> with string keys | PASSED | 8/8 must-haves | 2026-02-07 |
| 15: HTTP Actor Model | Actor-per-connection with crash isolation | PASSED | 3/3 must-haves | 2026-02-07 |

**Score: 5/5 phases passed (100%)**

## Cross-Phase Integration

| Integration Point | Phases | Status | Evidence |
|-------------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Multi-clause + String patterns | 11 + 13 | ✓ Connected | Shared pattern infrastructure (parse_pattern, MirLiteral::String) |
| Multi-clause closures + Pipes | 11 + 12 | ✓ Connected | Closure reuses parse_fn_clause_param_list; infer_pipe handles CallExpr |
| String patterns + Map values | 13 + 14 | ✓ Connected | Map.get returns strings matchable via snow_string_eq |
| Pipes + Map operations | 12 + 14 | ✓ Connected | Pipe desugaring compatible with Map API signatures |
| HTTP actors + Map types | 15 + 14 | ✓ Connected | HTTP request headers/params use Map<String, String> |
| HTTP actors + Multi-clause | 15 + 11 | ✓ Connected | Route handlers can be multi-clause functions |

**Score: 6/6 integration points verified (100%)**

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Multi-clause function with string literal patterns | ✓ Complete |
| 2 | Pipe chain with multi-clause closure | ✓ Complete |
| 3 | Map with string keys and pattern matching | ✓ Complete |
| 4 | HTTP request with Map headers | ✓ Complete |
| 5 | Comprehensive data pipeline (Map → Pipe → Closures → Pattern match) | ✓ Complete |
| 6 | HTTP crash isolation (panic in handler, server survives) | ✓ Complete |

**Score: 6/6 E2E flows complete (100%)**

## Shared Infrastructure

| Infrastructure | Used By | Status |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| Pattern parsing (parse_pattern) | P11 multi-clause, P12 closures, P13 string patterns | No conflicts |
| Pattern compilation (lower_pattern) | case, multi-clause, closures | No conflicts |
| Type inference (HM unification) | All phases | No conflicts |
| snow_string_eq runtime | P13 patterns, P14 map keys, P13 binary compare | No conflicts |

## Anti-Patterns & Tech Debt

**None.** All five phase verifications report zero blocking anti-patterns:
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments in shipped code
- No stub implementations
- No empty return patterns
- All functions have substantive implementations

## Test Results

| Test Suite | Passed | Failed |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Parser (snow-parser) | 210 | 0 |
| Type checker (snow-typeck) | 210+ | 0 |
| Codegen (snow-codegen) | 85 | 0 |
| Runtime (snow-rt) | 210 | 0 |
| Formatter (snow-fmt) | 85 | 0 |
| E2E tests | 24+ | 0 |
| **Total** | **All pass** | **0** |

## Summary
