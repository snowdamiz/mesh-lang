# Milestone v8.0: Developer Tooling

**Status:** In Progress
**Phases:** 81-86
**Total Plans:** TBD

## Overview

Make Mesh installable, editable, and navigable. Complete the TextMate grammar for all 48 keywords and missing syntax, add LSP document symbols and code intelligence (completion, signature help, formatting), build a CI pipeline with prebuilt binaries and a one-line install script, publish the VS Code extension to both marketplaces, audit the REPL and formatter for v7.0 compatibility, and fix documentation inaccuracies.

## Phases

### Phase 81: Grammar + Document Symbols

**Goal**: Users get complete syntax highlighting for all Mesh language features and can navigate code structure via Outline, Breadcrumbs, and Go to Symbol
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v8.0)
**Requirements**: GRAM-01, GRAM-02, GRAM-03, GRAM-04, GRAM-05, GRAM-06, GRAM-07, GRAM-08, GRAM-09, GRAM-10, SYM-01, SYM-02, SYM-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All 48 Mesh keywords are syntax-highlighted in VS Code (control flow, declaration, actor/supervision)
  2. Doc comments (`##`, `##!`), hex/binary/scientific literals, triple-quoted strings, and all operators are highlighted with correct scopes
  3. Website Shiki highlighting reflects the same grammar updates (shared file, zero separate work)
  4. VS Code Outline panel shows hierarchical symbols for fn, struct, module, actor, service, supervisor, interface, impl, and let bindings
  5. Go to Symbol (Cmd+Shift+O) lists all definitions in the current file with correct symbol kinds
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 81-01-PLAN.md -- TextMate grammar: keywords, operators, doc comments, literals, triple-quoted strings, module-qualified calls, nil removal
- [ ] 81-02-PLAN.md -- LSP document symbols: CST walk, SymbolKind mapping, range/selection_range, capability advertisement

### Phase 82: Install Infrastructure

**Goal**: Users can install meshc on macOS or Linux with a single `curl | sh` command backed by prebuilt binaries from GitHub Releases
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of Phase 81)
**Requirements**: DIST-01, DIST-02, DIST-03, INST-01, INST-02, INST-03, INST-04, INST-05, INST-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `curl -sSf https://mesh-lang.org/install.sh | sh` downloads and installs meshc on a clean macOS or Linux system
  2. Install script auto-detects platform and architecture, including Rosetta detection on Apple Silicon
  3. Installed binary passes SHA-256 checksum verification before extraction
  4. `meshc --version` works after install without manual PATH configuration
  5. Re-running the install script updates to a newer version without breaking the existing install
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 82-01-PLAN.md -- GitHub Actions CI: release workflow, matrix build (4 targets), LLVM installation, tarball + checksum creation, GitHub Release
- [ ] 82-02-PLAN.md -- Install script: platform detection, checksum verification, PATH configuration, idempotent updates, --yes flag

### Phase 83: LSP Completion + Signature Help

**Goal**: Users get intelligent code suggestions and function parameter info while typing Mesh code
**Depends on**: Nothing (parallel with Phase 82; benefits from Phase 81 patterns but no hard dependency)
**Requirements**: COMP-01, COMP-02, COMP-03, COMP-04, SIG-01, SIG-02, SIG-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Typing a partial keyword or type name shows matching completions (keywords, built-in types)
  2. Typing inside a function body shows in-scope variable and function names from CST walk
  3. Snippet completions expand common patterns (fn, let, struct, match, for, while, actor, interface, impl)
  4. Typing inside function call parentheses shows parameter names and types
  5. Active parameter highlighting advances as the user types each comma
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 83-01-PLAN.md -- Code completion: keyword/type/snippet completion, scope-aware variable completion from CST walk, capability advertisement
- [ ] 83-02-PLAN.md -- Signature help: parameter extraction from type schemes, active parameter tracking, trigger characters

### Phase 84: VS Code Extension Publishing

**Goal**: Users can discover and install the Mesh extension from VS Code Marketplace or Open VSX with one click
**Depends on**: Phase 81 (grammar must be complete before publishing), Phase 82 (install script must exist for error messages)
**Requirements**: EXT-01, EXT-02, EXT-03, EXT-04, EXT-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Searching "mesh" in VS Code Extensions sidebar finds and installs `mesh-lang.mesh-lang`
  2. Extension is available on Open VSX for Cursor, VSCodium, and Windsurf users
  3. Extension marketplace page shows icon, description, screenshots, and CHANGELOG
  4. Published .vsix contains no dev files, secrets, or unnecessary artifacts
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 84-01-PLAN.md -- Marketplace metadata: icon, README, CHANGELOG, .vsixignore, version bump to 0.2.0
- [ ] 84-02-PLAN.md -- Publishing: VS Code Marketplace + Open VSX, CI/CD automation on tag push

### Phase 85: LSP Formatting + Audit

**Goal**: Users can format Mesh files from VS Code and trust that the formatter and REPL handle all current language features
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent, can run parallel with any phase)
**Requirements**: FMT-01, AUDIT-01, AUDIT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. "Format Document" in VS Code formats the current Mesh file using mesh_fmt
  2. Formatter correctly handles for/while loops, trait/impl blocks, associated types, and iterator pipelines without dropping or mangling code
  3. REPL correctly evaluates iterators, From/Into conversions, numeric trait expressions, and collect operations
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 85-01-PLAN.md -- LSP formatting handler, formatter audit for v1.7-v7.0 syntax, REPL audit for v7.0 features

### Phase 86: Documentation Corrections

**Goal**: Users following the getting-started guide can install and run Mesh successfully on a clean system
**Depends on**: Phase 82 (install script must be production-ready for docs to reference)
**Requirements**: DOCS-01, DOCS-02, DOCS-03, DOCS-04, DOCS-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Getting-started guide uses `meshc` (not `mesh`) as the binary name
  2. Landing page install command is the real working `curl | sh` one-liner
  3. Hero section version badge shows current version (not `v0.1.0`)
  4. Getting-started description accurately says "compiled via LLVM" (not "compiles through Rust")
  5. All code examples in getting-started work when copy-pasted and run with `meshc`
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 86-01-PLAN.md -- Fix version badge + install URL in landing page components and config; rewrite getting-started guide with correct binary name, install command, LLVM description, and project-based code examples
