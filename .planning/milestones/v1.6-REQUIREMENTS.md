# Requirements: Snow v1.6

**Defined:** 2026-02-08
**Core Value:** Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural as sequential code, with supervision and fault tolerance built in.

## v1.6 Requirements

Requirements for method dot-syntax milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Method Resolution

- [x] **METH-01**: User can call trait impl methods via dot syntax (`value.method(args)`) -- SATISFIED
- [x] **METH-02**: Receiver is automatically passed as the first argument to the resolved impl method -- SATISFIED
- [x] **METH-03**: Method resolution searches all trait impl blocks for the receiver's type -- SATISFIED
- [x] **METH-04**: Methods on primitive types work via dot syntax (`42.to_string()`, `true.to_string()`) -- SATISFIED
- [x] **METH-05**: Methods on generic types work via dot syntax (`my_list.to_string()` where `List<T>` implements Display) -- SATISFIED

### Chaining

- [x] **CHAIN-01**: User can chain method calls (`point.to_string().length()`) -- SATISFIED
- [x] **CHAIN-02**: User can mix field access and method calls (`person.name.to_string()`) -- SATISFIED

### Diagnostics

- [x] **DIAG-01**: Calling a nonexistent method produces "no method `x` on type `Y`" error (not "no field") -- SATISFIED
- [x] **DIAG-02**: Ambiguous method (multiple traits) produces error listing conflicting traits with qualified syntax suggestion -- SATISFIED
- [x] **DIAG-03**: Ambiguity uses deterministic ordering (not HashMap iteration order) -- SATISFIED

### Integration

- [x] **INTG-01**: Struct field access (`point.x`) continues to work unchanged -- SATISFIED
- [x] **INTG-02**: Module-qualified calls (`String.length(s)`) continue to work unchanged -- SATISFIED
- [x] **INTG-03**: Pipe operator (`value |> method(args)`) continues to work unchanged -- SATISFIED
- [x] **INTG-04**: Sum type variant access (`Shape.Circle`) continues to work unchanged -- SATISFIED
- [x] **INTG-05**: `self` inside actor receive blocks is not affected by method calls -- SATISFIED

## Future Requirements

### Method Extensions

- **METH-06**: Inherent methods (`impl Type do ... end` without a trait)
- **METH-07**: Method references as values (`let f = value.method`)
- **METH-08**: IDE autocomplete for available methods after `.`

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| UFCS (any function callable via dot) | Pipe operator covers this use case; UFCS blurs method/function distinction |
| Auto-ref/auto-deref on receiver | Snow has no references; all values are value-typed |
| Method overloading by parameter count | Snow does not support function overloading |
| Implicit self in method bodies | Ambiguity between locals and fields; explicit `self.x` is clearer |
| Extension methods without traits | Breaks coherence; use pipe + module functions instead |
| Dynamic dispatch / vtables | Snow uses static dispatch via monomorphization |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| METH-01 | Phase 30 | Complete |
| METH-02 | Phase 30 | Complete |
| METH-03 | Phase 30 | Complete |
| METH-04 | Phase 31 | Complete |
| METH-05 | Phase 31 | Complete |
| CHAIN-01 | Phase 31 | Complete |
| CHAIN-02 | Phase 31 | Complete |
| DIAG-01 | Phase 30 | Complete |
| DIAG-02 | Phase 32 | Complete |
| DIAG-03 | Phase 32 | Complete |
| INTG-01 | Phase 32 | Complete |
| INTG-02 | Phase 32 | Complete |
| INTG-03 | Phase 32 | Complete |
| INTG-04 | Phase 32 | Complete |
| INTG-05 | Phase 32 | Complete |

**Coverage:**
- v1.6 requirements: 15 total
- Satisfied: 15
- Unsatisfied: 0

**Notes:**
- All requirements satisfied with zero gaps
- No requirements changed, dropped, or adjusted during milestone
- Future requirements (METH-06, METH-07, METH-08) carried forward for consideration in next milestone
