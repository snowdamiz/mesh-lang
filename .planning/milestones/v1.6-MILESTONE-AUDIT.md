# Milestone v1.6 Method Dot-Syntax - Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-09
**Status:** PASSED
**Phases:** 30-32 (3 phases, 6 plans)

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| METH-01 | Call trait impl methods via dot syntax | Phase 30 | SATISFIED |
| METH-02 | Receiver automatically passed as first argument | Phase 30 | SATISFIED |
| METH-03 | Resolution searches all trait impl blocks | Phase 30 | SATISFIED |
| METH-04 | Primitives work via dot syntax (42.to_string()) | Phase 31 | SATISFIED |
| METH-05 | Generics work via dot syntax (my_list.to_string()) | Phase 31 | SATISFIED |
| CHAIN-01 | Chained method calls (p.to_string().length()) | Phase 31 | SATISFIED |
| CHAIN-02 | Mixed field+method (p.name.length()) | Phase 31 | SATISFIED |
| DIAG-01 | NoSuchMethod error (not NoSuchField) | Phase 30 | SATISFIED |
| DIAG-02 | Ambiguous method lists conflicting traits | Phase 32 | SATISFIED |
| DIAG-03 | Deterministic alphabetical ordering | Phase 32 | SATISFIED |
| INTG-01 | Struct field access preserved | Phase 32 | SATISFIED |
| INTG-02 | Module-qualified calls preserved | Phase 32 | SATISFIED |
| INTG-03 | Pipe operator preserved | Phase 32 | SATISFIED |
| INTG-04 | Sum type variant access preserved | Phase 32 | SATISFIED |
| INTG-05 | Actor self in receive blocks preserved | Phase 32 | SATISFIED |

**Score: 15/15 requirements satisfied**

## Phase Verification

| Phase | Goal | Verification Status | Score |
|-------|------|---------------------|-------|
| 30: Core Method Resolution | Dot syntax on struct values with auto receiver passing | PASSED | 9/9 truths |
| 31: Extended Method Support | Primitives, generics, chaining, mixed field/method | PASSED | 9/9 truths |
| 32: Diagnostics and Integration | Polished diagnostics, backward compatibility | PASSED | 10/10 truths |

**Score: 3/3 phases passed**

## Cross-Phase Integration

| Integration Point | From | To | Status |
|-------------------|------|-----|--------|
| Retry mechanism for non-struct types | Phase 30 (infer_call retry) | Phase 31 (NoSuchField for Ty::Con/App) | CONNECTED |
| MIR stdlib module fallback | Phase 30 (resolve_trait_callee) | Phase 31 (string_/list_ prefix mapping) | CONNECTED |
| AmbiguousMethod span field | Phase 30 (error variant) | Phase 32 (TextRange span) | CONNECTED |
| Display registration for collections | Phase 31 (builtins.rs) | Phase 32 (integration tests) | CONNECTED |
| Guard chain preservation | All phases | Existing syntax forms | CONNECTED |

**Score: 5/5 integration points connected**

## E2E User Flows

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Basic method call | `point.to_string()` resolves and executes | COMPLETE |
| Primitive method call | `42.to_string()` resolves through retry | COMPLETE |
| Generic method call | `my_list.to_string()` with Display registration | COMPLETE |
| Chained method call | `point.to_string().length()` end-to-end | COMPLETE |
| Mixed field+method | `person.name.length()` end-to-end | COMPLETE |
| Ambiguity diagnostic | Deterministic alphabetical error for multi-trait | COMPLETE |
| Backward compatibility | INTG-01 through INTG-05 all pass | COMPLETE |

**Score: 7/7 flows complete**

## Tech Debt

None. No TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER markers in Phase 30-32 code. No stub implementations. No deferred items.

## Anti-Patterns

None found across any phase verification.

## Test Coverage

- Phase 30: 10 new tests (5 MIR-level + 5 e2e)
- Phase 31: 6 new e2e tests
- Phase 32: 7 new tests (2 diagnostic snapshots + 5 integration e2e)
- **Total new: 23 tests**
- **Full workspace: 1,255 tests pass, 0 regressions**

## Summary

Milestone v1.6 Method Dot-Syntax is complete with all 15 requirements satisfied, all 3 phases verified, all cross-phase integration points connected, and all 7 E2E user flows working. Zero tech debt, zero anti-patterns, zero regressions.
