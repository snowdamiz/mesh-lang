## Cross-Phase Integration

### Compiler Pipeline Boundaries

| From | To | Interface | Status |
|------|----|-----------|--------|
| Lexer (P1) | Parser (P2) | `Lexer::tokenize()` -> `Parser::new(tokens)` | CONNECTED |
| Parser (P2) | Type Checker (P3) | `parse()` -> `check(&parse)` | CONNECTED |
| Type Checker (P3) | MIR Lowering (P5) | `TypeckResult` -> `Lowerer::new(&typeck)` | CONNECTED |
| MIR Lowering (P5) | LLVM Codegen (P5) | `MirModule` -> `CodeGen::compile(&mir)` | CONNECTED |
| LLVM Codegen (P5) | Runtime (P6) | Intrinsic decls -> `extern "C"` exports | CONNECTED |
| Runtime (P6) | Supervision (P7) | Actor primitives -> supervisor functions | CONNECTED |
| Runtime (P6) | Stdlib (P8) | Runtime functions -> stdlib implementations | CONNECTED |
| Runtime (P6) | Service/Job (P9) | Actor primitives -> service/job abstractions | CONNECTED |
| Compiler (P5) | Tooling (P10) | Parse/Typeck APIs -> fmt/repl/lsp | CONNECTED |

**All 9 cross-phase boundaries verified as connected.**

### E2E User Flows

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Hello World | Write source -> compile -> run | COMPLETE |
| Concurrent Service | Service def -> compile -> run with typed messaging | COMPLETE |
| Error Handling | Bad code -> helpful error messages (JSON + human) | COMPLETE |
| New Project | `snowc init` -> edit -> build -> run | COMPLETE |
| Formatter | Messy code -> `snowc fmt` -> canonical style | COMPLETE |

**All 5 E2E user flows verified as complete.**

## Tech Debt Summary

**10 items across 6 categories. No blockers.**

### Phase 4: Pattern Matching
- Multi-clause function definitions deferred (pattern matching on function args). Workaround: single-clause + case expressions.

### Phase 5: Codegen
- String comparison uses runtime fallback in pattern codegen. No E2E tests rely on string pattern matching.

### Phase 7: Supervision
- Supervisor uses noop entry function; the actual receive loop is compiler-generated. All supervision logic is implemented and tested.
- `decode_exit_signal` exported but automatic invocation deferred to compiled receive loops.

### Phase 8: Standard Library
- HTTP server uses `std::thread::spawn` instead of actor-per-connection. Documented architectural decision.
- Pipe operator `|>` cannot be used with inline closures due to parser cross-line expression merging. Workaround: direct function calls or `let` bindings.

### Phase 9: Concurrency Standard Library
- Unused struct fields `variant_name` in CallInfo/CastInfo (minor dead code).

### General
- Dead code warnings across lexer/parser (source field, is_eof method, Event::Error variant). Info level, no functional impact.
- Dead code in MIR lowering (`resolve_range_closure`, `lower_let_binding`). Can be cleaned up.

## Conclusion

**v1 Milestone: PASSED**

- **47/47** requirements satisfied
- **10/10** phases verified
- **9/9** cross-phase boundaries connected
- **5/5** E2E user flows complete
- **0** critical gaps or blockers
- **10** tech debt items (all non-blocking, documented)

The Snow programming language v1 milestone has been achieved. The compiler produces native single-binary executables from Snow source code with full support for: Elixir-style syntax, static HM type inference, BEAM-style actor concurrency, supervision trees, a comprehensive standard library, and developer tooling (formatter, REPL, package manager, LSP).
