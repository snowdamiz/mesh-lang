# Snow

## What This Is

Snow is a programming language that combines Elixir/Ruby-style expressive syntax with static Hindley-Milner type inference and BEAM-style concurrency (actors, supervision trees, fault tolerance), compiled via LLVM to native single-binary executables. The compiler is written in Rust. v1.0 ships a complete compiler pipeline, actor runtime, standard library, and developer tooling (formatter, REPL, package manager, LSP).

## Core Value

Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural and clean as writing sequential code, with the safety net of supervision and fault tolerance built into the language.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Elixir/Ruby-style syntax (do/end blocks, pattern matching, keyword-based, minimal punctuation) -- v1.0
- ✓ Static type system with Hindley-Milner inference (rarely write type annotations) -- v1.0
- ✓ BEAM-style concurrency: lightweight actor processes with typed message passing -- v1.0
- ✓ Supervision trees with let-it-crash fault tolerance -- v1.0
- ✓ LLVM backend producing native single-binary executables (runtime bundled) -- v1.0
- ✓ Functional-first paradigm (no classes, no OOP hierarchies) -- v1.0
- ✓ General purpose -- suitable for web backends/APIs and CLI tools -- v1.0
- ✓ Pattern matching as a core language feature with exhaustiveness checking -- v1.0
- ✓ Standard library sufficient for HTTP servers and file I/O -- v1.0
- ✓ Developer tooling: formatter, REPL, package manager, LSP server -- v1.0

### Active

(None -- v1.0 complete. Define for next milestone via `/gsd:new-milestone`)

### Out of Scope

- Classes and OOP -- functional-first design, use structs/traits/protocols instead
- Systems programming (drivers, embedded, OS-level) -- not targeting bare-metal performance
- GUI framework -- web and CLI are the primary targets
- Self-hosting compiler -- Rust is the compiler language, bootstrapping is not a v1 goal
- Operator overloading -- creates hidden semantics, hurts readability
- Shared mutable state between actors -- defeats actor model, causes data races
- Null/nil values -- Option<T> is the only way to represent absence
- Exceptions (try/catch/throw) -- Result<T,E> + let-it-crash philosophy replaces them
- Async/await colored functions -- runtime handles concurrency transparently
- Inheritance -- functional paradigm uses composition + traits instead
- Manual memory management -- per-actor GC handles this

## Context

Shipped v1.0 with 52,611 lines of Rust across 107 source files.
Tech stack: Rust compiler, LLVM 21 (Inkwell 0.8), corosensei coroutines, rowan CST, ariadne diagnostics.
Crates: snow-lexer, snow-parser, snow-typeck, snow-mir, snow-codegen, snow-rt, snow-fmt, snow-repl, snow-pkg, snow-lsp, snowc.

Known limitations for future work:
- Multi-clause function definitions (workaround: case expressions)
- String comparison in pattern matching (runtime fallback)
- Pipe operator with inline closures (parser limitation)
- HTTP server uses thread-per-connection (not actor-per-connection)
- Map.put typed as (Map, Int, Int) -- string-keyed maps need refinement

## Constraints

- **Compiler language**: Rust -- chosen for safety, LLVM ecosystem (inkwell), and compiler development ergonomics
- **Compilation target**: LLVM IR -- enables native binaries across platforms without writing multiple backends
- **No OOP**: Functional paradigm only -- structs, traits/protocols, pattern matching. No class hierarchies.
- **Runtime**: Actor runtime bundled into the binary. Lightweight enough to not bloat small CLI tools.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Rust for compiler | Strong LLVM bindings, memory safe, good for complex software | ✓ Good -- 52K LOC Rust, stable compiler |
| LLVM as backend | Proven codegen, multi-platform, avoids writing own backend | ✓ Good -- native binaries on macOS/Linux |
| Elixir/Ruby syntax style | Expressive, readable, pattern matching native | ✓ Good -- clean do/end blocks, pipe operator |
| Static types with HM inference | Safety without verbosity | ✓ Good -- rarely need annotations |
| No OOP | Functional-first aligns with actor model | ✓ Good -- simpler language, structs+traits sufficient |
| Bundled runtime | Single binary deployment like Go | ✓ Good -- self-contained executables |
| Angle brackets <T> for generics | Disambiguates from list syntax | ✓ Good -- migrated from [T] in Phase 3 |
| corosensei for coroutines | M:N scheduling without OS threads per actor | ✓ Good -- 100K actors in ~2.78s |
| Rowan for CST | Lossless syntax tree, editor tooling support | ✓ Good -- powers formatter and LSP |
| Thread-per-connection HTTP | Simpler than actor-per-connection for v1 | ⚠️ Revisit -- may want actor-based in v2 |
| Arena/bump allocation for GC | Simple, fast allocation for v1 | ⚠️ Revisit -- true mark-sweep needed for long-running actors |
