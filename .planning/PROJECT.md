# Snow

## What This Is

Snow is a programming language that combines Elixir/Ruby-style expressive syntax with static Hindley-Milner type inference and BEAM-style concurrency (actors, supervision trees, fault tolerance), compiled via LLVM to native single-binary executables. The compiler is written in Rust. v1.0 shipped a complete compiler pipeline, actor runtime, standard library, and developer tooling. v1.1 polished the language by resolving all five documented v1.0 limitations. v1.2 added Fun() type annotations and a mark-sweep garbage collector for per-actor heaps. v1.3 focuses on completing the trait/protocol system and adding stdlib protocols for server development.

## Core Value

Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural and clean as writing sequential code, with the safety net of supervision and fault tolerance built into the language.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Elixir/Ruby-style syntax (do/end blocks, pattern matching, keyword-based, minimal punctuation) -- v1.0
- ✓ Static type system with Hindley-Milner inference (rarely write type annotations) -- v1.0
- ✓ BEAM-style concurrency: lightweight actor processes with typed message passing -- v1.0
- ✓ Supervision trees with let-it-crash fault tolerance -- v1.0
- ✓ LLVM backend producing native single-binary executables (runtime bundled) -- v1.0
- ✓ Functional-first paradigm (no classes, no OOP hierarchies) -- v1.0
- ✓ General purpose -- suitable for web backends/APIs and CLI tools -- v1.0
- ✓ Pattern matching as a core language feature with exhaustiveness checking -- v1.0
- ✓ Standard library sufficient for HTTP servers and file I/O -- v1.0
- ✓ Developer tooling: formatter, REPL, package manager, LSP server -- v1.0
- ✓ Multi-clause function definitions with guard clauses and exhaustiveness warnings -- v1.1
- ✓ String comparison in pattern matching (compile-time string matching via snow_string_eq) -- v1.1
- ✓ Pipe operator with inline closures (full closure rewrite + pipe-aware type inference) -- v1.1
- ✓ Actor-per-connection HTTP server with catch_unwind crash isolation -- v1.1
- ✓ Generic map types Map<K, V> with string keys and map literal syntax -- v1.1
- ✓ Fun() type annotation parsed as function type instead of type constructor -- v1.2
- ✓ Mark-sweep garbage collector for per-actor heaps (replacing arena/bump allocation) -- v1.2

### Active

**Current Milestone: v1.3 Traits & Protocols**

**Goal:** Complete the trait system for user-defined interfaces and impls with static dispatch, and ship stdlib protocols that enable server-oriented abstractions (serialization, iteration, conversion, hashing).

**Target features:**
- User-defined `interface` definitions with method signatures and default implementations
- `impl` blocks to implement interfaces for concrete types
- Where clauses working with user-defined traits
- Trait-based operator overloading for user types (impl Add for MyType)
- Static dispatch via monomorphization in codegen
- Stdlib protocols: Display, Iterator, From/Into, Serialize/Deserialize, Hash, Default

### Out of Scope

- Classes and OOP -- functional-first design, use structs/traits/protocols instead
- Systems programming (drivers, embedded, OS-level) -- not targeting bare-metal performance
- GUI framework -- web and CLI are the primary targets
- Self-hosting compiler -- Rust is the compiler language, bootstrapping is not a v1 goal
- Ad-hoc operator overloading -- trait-based overloading (impl Add for T) is supported; arbitrary symbol overloading is not
- Shared mutable state between actors -- defeats actor model, causes data races
- Null/nil values -- Option<T> is the only way to represent absence
- Exceptions (try/catch/throw) -- Result<T,E> + let-it-crash philosophy replaces them
- Async/await colored functions -- runtime handles concurrency transparently
- Inheritance -- functional paradigm uses composition + traits instead
- Manual memory management -- per-actor GC handles this
- Generational GC -- mark-sweep sufficient for now; generational optimization is future work
- Concurrent/incremental GC -- per-actor isolation means pauses only affect one actor
- Compacting GC -- mark-sweep with free-list is sufficient

## Context

Shipped v1.2 with 57,657 lines of Rust (+1,118 from v1.1).
Tech stack: Rust compiler, LLVM 21 (Inkwell 0.8), corosensei coroutines, rowan CST, ariadne diagnostics.
Crates: snow-lexer, snow-parser, snow-typeck, snow-mir, snow-codegen, snow-rt, snow-fmt, snow-repl, snow-pkg, snow-lsp, snowc.

All known issues resolved through v1.2:
- v1.0 limitations (multi-clause functions, string matching, pipe+closures, HTTP actors, maps) -- fixed in v1.1
- Fun() type annotation parsing -- fixed in v1.2
- Arena/bump allocation GC -- replaced with mark-sweep in v1.2

1,018 tests passing across all crates. Zero known bugs. Zero tech debt.

v1.3 trait system status: Parser already handles `interface` and `impl` syntax. TraitRegistry in snow-typeck handles trait definitions, impl registration, and method validation. Compiler-known traits (Add, Eq, Ord, etc.) work with built-in impls for primitives. Where clauses parse and validate. Codegen currently skips InterfaceDef/ImplDef ("interfaces are erased"). The gap is user-defined traits and codegen integration (monomorphization).

## Constraints

- **Compiler language**: Rust -- chosen for safety, LLVM ecosystem (inkwell), and compiler development ergonomics
- **Compilation target**: LLVM IR -- enables native binaries across platforms without writing multiple backends
- **No OOP**: Functional paradigm only -- structs, traits/protocols, pattern matching. No class hierarchies.
- **Runtime**: Actor runtime bundled into the binary. Lightweight enough to not bloat small CLI tools.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Rust for compiler | Strong LLVM bindings, memory safe, good for complex software | ✓ Good -- 57K LOC Rust, stable compiler |
| LLVM as backend | Proven codegen, multi-platform, avoids writing own backend | ✓ Good -- native binaries on macOS/Linux |
| Elixir/Ruby syntax style | Expressive, readable, pattern matching native | ✓ Good -- clean do/end blocks, pipe operator |
| Static types with HM inference | Safety without verbosity | ✓ Good -- rarely need annotations |
| No OOP | Functional-first aligns with actor model | ✓ Good -- simpler language, structs+traits sufficient |
| Bundled runtime | Single binary deployment like Go | ✓ Good -- self-contained executables |
| Angle brackets <T> for generics | Disambiguates from list syntax | ✓ Good -- migrated from [T] in Phase 3 |
| corosensei for coroutines | M:N scheduling without OS threads per actor | ✓ Good -- 100K actors in ~2.78s |
| Rowan for CST | Lossless syntax tree, editor tooling support | ✓ Good -- powers formatter and LSP |
| Actor-per-connection HTTP | Crash isolation, lightweight, uses existing actor runtime | ✓ Good -- v1.1, replaced threads with actors |
| Mark-sweep GC for actor heaps | Arena/bump allocation caused unbounded growth in long-running actors | ✓ Good -- v1.2, bounded memory validated |
| Lazy key_type tagging for Maps | HM let-generalization prevents type resolution at Map.new() | ✓ Good -- runtime dispatch at put/get sites |
| Pipe-aware type inference | infer_pipe handles CallExpr RHS, prepends lhs_ty before arity check | ✓ Good -- enables pipe+closure chains |
| panic!() instead of abort() | catch_unwind requires catchable panics for crash isolation | ✓ Good -- actors survive peer crashes |
| Fun() as text-comparison, not keyword | Type-position disambiguation only; avoids breaking existing code | ✓ Good -- v1.2, clean integration with HM |
| Conservative stack scanning | No type maps yet; every 8-byte word treated as potential pointer | ✓ Good -- safe, may retain some garbage |
| GC at yield points only | Cooperative; never interrupts other actors | ✓ Good -- per-actor isolation preserved |

| Static dispatch for traits | Monomorphization fits LLVM codegen naturally, no runtime vtable overhead, actor system provides dynamic routing where needed | — Pending |
