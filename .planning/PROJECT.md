# Snow

## What This Is

Snow is a programming language that combines Elixir/Ruby-style expressive syntax with static Hindley-Milner type inference and BEAM-style concurrency (actors, supervision trees, fault tolerance), compiled via LLVM to native single-binary executables. The compiler is written in Rust. v1.0-v1.9 built a complete language: compiler pipeline, actor runtime, trait system, module system, loops, stdlib, and developer tooling. v2.0 added database drivers and JSON serde. v3.0 made Snow production-ready: TLS encryption for PostgreSQL and HTTPS, connection pooling with health checks, panic-safe database transactions, and automatic struct-to-row mapping via `deriving(Row)`. 83K LOC Rust across 12 milestones. Zero known compiler correctness issues.

## Core Value

Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural and clean as writing sequential code, with the safety net of supervision and fault tolerance built into the language.

### Active

(No active requirements -- next milestone not yet planned)

### Out of Scope

- Classes and OOP -- functional-first design, use structs/traits/protocols instead
- Systems programming (drivers, embedded, OS-level) -- not targeting bare-metal performance
- GUI framework -- web and CLI are the primary targets
- Self-hosting compiler -- Rust is the compiler language, bootstrapping is not a v1 goal
- Ad-hoc operator overloading -- trait-based overloading (impl Add for T) is supported; arbitrary symbol overloading is not
- Shared mutable state between actors -- defeats actor model, causes data races
- Null/nil values -- Option<T> is the only way to represent absence
- Exceptions (try/catch/throw) -- Result<T,E> + let-it-crash philosophy replaces them
- Async/await colored functions -- runtime handles concurrency transparently
- Inheritance -- functional paradigm uses composition + traits instead
- Manual memory management -- per-actor GC handles this
- Generational GC -- mark-sweep sufficient for now; generational optimization is future work
- Concurrent/incremental GC -- per-actor isolation means pauses only affect one actor
- Compacting GC -- mark-sweep with free-list is sufficient
- Dynamic dispatch / vtables / trait objects -- use sum types instead; static dispatch via monomorphization
- Higher-kinded types (Functor/Monad) -- out of language philosophy
- Specialization (overlapping impls) -- unsound without careful design; not planned
- UFCS (any function callable via dot) -- pipe operator covers this use case; UFCS blurs method/function distinction
- Auto-ref/auto-deref on receiver -- Snow has no references; all values are value-typed
- Method overloading by parameter count -- Snow does not support function overloading
- Extension methods without traits -- breaks coherence; use pipe + module functions instead

## Context

Shipped v3.0 with 83,451 lines of Rust (+2,445 from v2.0).
Tech stack: Rust compiler, LLVM 21 (Inkwell 0.8), corosensei coroutines, rowan CST, ariadne diagnostics.
Crates: snow-lexer, snow-parser, snow-typeck, snow-mir, snow-codegen, snow-rt, snow-fmt, snow-repl, snow-pkg, snow-lsp, snowc.
Deps: libsqlite3-sys (bundled), sha2/hmac/md-5/base64ct (PG auth), rustls 0.23/webpki-roots/ring (TLS).
Removed: tiny_http (replaced with hand-rolled HTTP/1.1 parser in v3.0).

290+ tests passing (including 18 new v3.0 tests). Zero known critical bugs. Zero known compiler correctness issues.

Known limitations: None.

Tech debt (minor, pre-existing):
- List.find Option return pattern matching triggers LLVM verification error with case expression (pre-existing codegen gap)
- Timer e2e tests flake under high parallelism (5s timeout too tight when CPU-contended; pass with --test-threads=1)
- Pre-existing TODO in lower.rs:5947 for string comparison callback
- build_module_graph wrapper in discovery.rs used only in Phase 37 tests -- consider deprecation
- report_diagnostics function in main.rs appears to be dead code
- 3 compiler warnings (fixable with `cargo fix`)
- Middleware requires explicit `:: Request` parameter type annotations (incomplete inference)
- PostgreSQL E2E test requires external server, marked `#[ignore]`
- 1 dead_code warning in snow-rt build
- No cross-feature integration tests (HTTP+JSON, DB+JSON)

## Constraints

- **Compiler language**: Rust -- chosen for safety, LLVM ecosystem (inkwell), and compiler development ergonomics
- **Compilation target**: LLVM IR -- enables native binaries across platforms without writing multiple backends
- **No OOP**: Functional paradigm only -- structs, traits/protocols, pattern matching. No class hierarchies.
- **Runtime**: Actor runtime bundled into the binary. Lightweight enough to not bloat small CLI tools.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Rust for compiler | Strong LLVM bindings, memory safe, good for complex software | ✓ Good -- 76K LOC Rust, stable compiler |
| LLVM as backend | Proven codegen, multi-platform, avoids writing own backend | ✓ Good -- native binaries on macOS/Linux |
| Elixir/Ruby syntax style | Expressive, readable, pattern matching native | ✓ Good -- clean do/end blocks, pipe operator |
| Static types with HM inference | Safety without verbosity | ✓ Good -- rarely need annotations |
| No OOP | Functional-first aligns with actor model | ✓ Good -- simpler language, structs+traits sufficient |
| Bundled runtime | Single binary deployment like Go | ✓ Good -- self-contained executables |
| Angle brackets <T> for generics | Disambiguates from list syntax | ✓ Good -- migrated from [T] in Phase 3 |
| corosensei for coroutines | M:N scheduling without OS threads per actor | ✓ Good -- 100K actors in ~2.78s |
| Rowan for CST | Lossless syntax tree, editor tooling support | ✓ Good -- powers formatter and LSP |
| Actor-per-connection HTTP | Crash isolation, lightweight, uses existing actor runtime | ✓ Good -- v1.1, replaced threads with actors |
| Mark-sweep GC for actor heaps | Arena/bump allocation caused unbounded growth in long-running actors | ✓ Good -- v1.2, bounded memory validated |
| Lazy key_type tagging for Maps | HM let-generalization prevents type resolution at Map.new() | ✓ Good -- runtime dispatch at put/get sites |
| Pipe-aware type inference | infer_pipe handles CallExpr RHS, prepends lhs_ty before arity check | ✓ Good -- enables pipe+closure chains |
| panic!() instead of abort() | catch_unwind requires catchable panics for crash isolation | ✓ Good -- actors survive peer crashes |
| Fun() as text-comparison, not keyword | Type-position disambiguation only; avoids breaking existing code | ✓ Good -- v1.2, clean integration with HM |
| Conservative stack scanning | No type maps yet; every 8-byte word treated as potential pointer | ✓ Good -- safe, may retain some garbage |
| GC at yield points only | Cooperative; never interrupts other actors | ✓ Good -- per-actor isolation preserved |
| Static dispatch for traits | Monomorphization fits LLVM codegen naturally, no runtime vtable overhead | ✓ Good -- v1.3, zero-overhead trait calls |
| MIR lowering as trait integration point | Type checker resolves concrete types; MIR mangles names and emits direct calls | ✓ Good -- v1.3, clean separation of concerns |

| Ordering as non-generic built-in | Simpler than Option/Result; no type parameters needed | ✓ Good -- v1.4, clean Ord integration |

| Local var precedence over builtin names | Pattern binding `head` was incorrectly mapped to snow_list_head | ✓ Good -- v1.5, correct name resolution |
| E0029 error + early-return for Ord without Eq | User opted into selective deriving; respect with clear error and suggestion | ✓ Good -- v1.5, user-friendly diagnostics |
| Soft error collection for argument constraints | Callee check returns Err; argument check uses extend to avoid aborting inference early | ✓ Good -- v1.5, non-disruptive constraint checking |

| Retry-based method resolution | Normal inference first, method-call fallback on NoSuchField; preserves backward compat | ✓ Good -- v1.6, zero regressions |
